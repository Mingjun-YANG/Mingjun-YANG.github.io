> Never quit studying

Hi, I am Mingjun Yang, a new graduate student from Northeastern University's Information Systems program. <br>

I'm currently looking for full-time software engineer oppotunities, so I'd like to thank you for visiting my website. You can get to know my academic background, work experience and skills from other articles here. [Work Experience](/2020/05/30/Work-Experience/), [Academic Background](/2020/05/30/Academic-Background), [Project Experience]() <dr>

I describe myself as a quick-learner as well as a impactful engineer. <dr>
I enjoy the process of exploring and solving problems by building applications, and I love to cooperate with other engineers to solve problem. <dr>

At this moment, I'm open to any kind of oppotunities and appreciate any chance to be considered as candidate for any software engineer position. <br>
